| [playground.py](cloud_shield_ai/generator/playground.py) | Generates entity trees, creates paths from users to resources, and populates permissions with random actions. Ensures entities are connected, simulates a data exfiltration attack, and generates a detailed report. |
| [actions.json](cloud_shield_ai/generator/actions.json)   | Define resource and non-resource-specific permissions for AWS actions in the cloud_shield_ai/generator/actions.json file. Map source (user, role, group) to destination (resource type).                             |
